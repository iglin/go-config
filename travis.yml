before_script:
  - go get github.com/schrej/godacov
script:
  - go test -race -coverprofile c.out  -covermode atomic ./...
after_script:
  - godacov -t $CODACY_TOKEN -r ./c.out -c $TRAVIS_COMMIT

## Anything in before_script that returns a nonzero exit code will flunk the
## build and immediately stop. It's sorta like having set -e enabled in bash.
## We can download and extract the golangci-lint binary in one (long) command.
#before_script:
#  - curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin v1.37.1
#
## script always runs to completion (set +e). If we have linter issues AND a
## failing test, we want to see both. Configure golangci-lint with a
## .golangci.yml file at the top level of your repo.
#script:
#  - golangci-lint run       # run a bunch of code checkers/linters in parallel
#  - go test -v -race ./...  # Run all the tests with the race detector enabled
